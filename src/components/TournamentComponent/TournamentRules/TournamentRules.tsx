            There are known bugs with custom game rules resetting. If game rules
            are incorrect, either the hosting or non-hosting team may leave to
            rehost and attempt to correct the settings. Due to these bugs, until
            it is fixed we will not be issuing forfeits or replays, as this is a
            common issue. All rounds played before leaving will be counted. If
            neither team leaves and both teams decide to play as is, the results
            will also stand. We recommend that you check if pings are enabled at
            the start of round 1 and leave immediately if so. Please note that
            if you leave to reset the rules and a player has streaks, the team
            that leaves the game may be forfeited a round for players having
            streaks.
